My name is Nicko. I am currently a student in the science and technology branch at my school.
At our IT department, I’m mainly responsible for setting up and maintaining all sorts of nasty Active Directory services. It keeps me busy — and maybe just a little bit cheeky —making sure everything stays secure and running smoothly.

Another great occupation of mine is home labbing. I love tinkering around with infrastrucure at home and setting up enterprise-ready environments without the pressure of costly downtimes ...

My greatest skills probably are in observability stacks (Promtheus (Thanos), Grafana, Opsgenie), THE CLOUD (Google Cloud & basic AWS), cybersecurity (TryHackeMe & HackTheBox experience), virtualization with Proxmox and XCP-ng, Ansible automation & Docker containerization.

As for programing languages I master Python & Java, as well as all kinds of web-development with HTML, CSS, JS & PHP.

**Stuff I like:**

- Linux / Unix
- Networking
- Cybersecurity
- Making people understand the value of privacy

**Stuff I dislike:**

- Sleeping over a problem
- Breaking drivers
- Dirty (code) documentation
- Redundancy

**Things outside tech:**

- Hiking
- Biking
- Reading books
- and ... _Tech_ ;D

## Books
I love reading and actually spend most of the free time I have to myself with books. They're very quiet friends who have a lot to say.

Therefore here is a curated list of my favorite works following. Maybe one or the other will find a nice new inspiration.
