My name is Nicko (as you have probably noticed from my domain). I am currently a student at the GCE in Bayreuth, in the science and technology branch.
At the IT department there I’m mostly responsible for setting up & maintaining Active Directory services.

One other great occupation of mine is home labbing. I love tinkering around with infrastrucure at home and setting up enterprise-ready environments without the pressure of costly downtimes ...

My greatest skills are in observability stack (Promtheus (Thanos), Grafana, Opsgenie), the cloud (Google Cloud & basic AWS), cybersecurity (TryHackeMe & HackTheBox experience), virtualization with Proxmox and XCP-ng, Ansible automation & Docker containerization.

As for programing languages I master Python & Shellscripting, web-development with HTML, CSS & basic JavaScript & PHP.

**Stuff I like:**
- Linux
- Networking
- Cybersecurity
- Making people understand the value of privacy

**Stuff I dislike:**
- Sleeping over a problem
- Breaking drivers
- Dirty (code) documentation
- Redundancy

**Things outside tech:**
- Boxing
- Biking
- Reading books
- and ... _Tech_ ;)

## Books
I love reading and actually spend most of the free time I have to myself with books. They're very quiet friends who have a lot to say.

Therefore here is a curated list of my favorite works following. Maybe one or the other will find a nice new inspiration.
