I entirely moved to using only cryptocurrency online because it is more in line with my principles of free software, freedom generally and self-custodianship. That said, I don't longer accept donations via normie platforms for the time being.

I can just recommend everyone to switch over to using Monero for transacting value digitally. Thank you!
