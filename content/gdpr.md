_This domain is for personal use only._

_Public websites on this domain do not store or share any of your data.
They don't contain any trackers and don't profile its visitors in any way._

Out of a long tradition of interest and deep love for data protection, I inform you in this privacy policy that I don't want to know who you are or when you find yourself on this website. Nor do I want to know how long you stay here, what you look at or even which website you visit afterwards.

Because your behaviour is none of my business, websites on this domain don't collect any data about your user behaviour and do not record any server logs.

However, please keep in mind that the websites on this domain contain links to various external websites. If you follow a link to any of these external websites, please note that they have their own privacy policies and I cannot accept any responsibility or liability for these third-party websites and their policies.

Data protection always begins and ends with personal data. Because the question of when a data item is personal is so important, the European legislator has inserted a legal definition for this in Art. 4 Lit.1 DSGVO:

> Personal data" means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person ("data subject"); an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person.

If you have questions about the data collection on this domain, feel free to contact me by email.

“We all need places where we can go to explore without the
judgmental eyes of other people being cast upon us, only in
a realm where we're not being watched can we really test the
limits of who we want to be. It's really in the private
realm where dissent, creativity and personal exploration
lie.”

- Glenn Greenwald
