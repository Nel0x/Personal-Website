      <description>Though I love docker and containerization, most of my infrastructure is still hosted on Virtual Machines via Proxmox. This has some obvious drawbacks like slower (re-)starting times, the use of more ressources due to the virtualized kernel &amp;amp; emulated hardware and harder automation of the deployment process.
That&amp;rsquo;s why I finally got myself to migrating my infrastructure over as well as discovering some new sysyems while exploring docker.
I will document the whole procedure with all it&amp;rsquo;s obstacles on this page, while starting with the basic and easy ones to warm up and then coming to more complex subjects, like storage sharing with Nextcloud and Syncthing.</description>

 This is a site dedicated to turning internet peasants into Internet Landlords by showing them how to setup websites, email servers, chat servers and everything in between.
Starting a website is something that can be done in a lazy afternoon and costs pocket change.
Most of the internet&amp;rsquo;s problems could be solved if more people had their own personal platforms, so the objective of this site is to guide any normal person through the process of installing a website.</description>
